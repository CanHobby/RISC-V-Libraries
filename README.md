# RISC-V-Libraries
Sample Libraries for RISC-V MCUs

This is my attempt to put together some C++ classes for RISC-V peripherals, trying to emulate the "Arduino" style, and in some cases creating compatible functions.  My goal is to make them universal acreoss all WCH MCUs where possible so they are arranged here by peripheral type.

I start with GPIO - "blinky" is "hello world" for MCUs.

Next is SPI because I use it for controlling NeoPixels.
